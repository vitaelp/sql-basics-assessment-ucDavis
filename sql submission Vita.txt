Data Scientist Role Play: Profiling and Analyzing the Yelp Dataset Coursera Worksheet

This is a 2-part assignment. In the first part, you are asked a series of questions that 
will help you profile and understand the data just like a data scientist would. For this 
first part of the assignment, you will be assessed both on the correctness of your 
findings, as well as the code you used to arrive at your answer. You will be graded on 
how easy your code is to read, so remember to use proper formatting and comments where 
necessary.

In the second part of the assignment, you are asked to come up with your own inferences 
and analysis of the data for a particular research question you want to answer. You will be 
required to prepare the dataset for the analysis you choose to do. As with the first part, 
you will be graded, in part, on how easy your code is to read, so use proper formatting 
and comments to illustrate and communicate your intent as required.

For both parts of this assignment, use this "worksheet." It provides all the questions 
you are being asked, and your job will be to transfer your answers and SQL coding where
indicated into this worksheet so that your peers can review your work. You should be able 
to use any Text Editor (Windows Notepad, Apple TextEdit, Notepad ++, Sublime Text, etc.) 
to copy and paste your answers. If you are going to use Word or some other page layout
application, just be careful to make sure your answers and code are lined appropriately.
In this case, you may want to save as a PDF to ensure your formatting remains intact
for you reviewer.




Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding

1. Profile the data by finding the total number of records for each of the tables below:
	
		SELECT COUNT(*)
		FROM table
	
	i. 		Attribute table = 10000
	ii. 	Business table = 10000
	iii. 	Category table = 10000
	iv. 	Checkin table = 10000
	v. 		elite_years table = 10000 
	vi. 	friend table = 10000
	vii. 	hours table = 10000
	viii. 	photo table = 10000
	ix. 	review table = 10000
	x. 		tip table = 10000
	xi. 	user table = 10000
	


2. Find the total number of distinct records for each of the keys listed below:

		SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT(key))
		FROM table

	i. 		Business = id: 10000
	ii. 	Hours = business_id: 1562
	iii. 	Category = business_id: 2643
	iv. 	Attribute = business_id: 1115
	v. 		Review = id:10000, business_id: 8090, user_id: 9581
	vi. 	Checkin = business_id: 493
	vii. 	Photo = id: 10000, business_id: 6493
	viii. 	Tip = user_id: 537, business_id: 3979
	ix. 	User = id: 10000
	x. 		Friend = user_id: 11
	xi. 	Elite_years = user_id: 2780
	


3. Are there any columns with null values in the Users table? Indicate "yes," or "no."

	Answer: no

8. Does posing more reviews correlate with more fans? 

		Yes, but also the amount of time that they have been yelping. The longer they 
		have been yelping and the more reviews they give has a higher fan count.

	Please explain your findings and interpretation of the results:
		
		Yes, BUT Harald! Other users seem to have a correlation with more `useful` and `funny`
		results in more fans, but also in conjunction with review_count and time.

i. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different distribution of hours?

The two groups certainly have different working hours, the ones with lower ratings are comparatively 
open for longer hours as compared to the ones with higher ratings. Also, the highly rated businesses 
are open for a much shorter time as compared to low rated businesses.

ii. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different number of reviews?

The two groups have different number of reviews as we can see in the result above. The highly rated 
businesses have recieved typically low reviews compared to the lowly rated ones. except for one exception 
of Edulis.
         
iii. Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two groups? Explain.

There isn't a clear indication of differences between the groups based on their locations but the ones that 
are closer to each other shae almost similar ratings based on neighborhood and postal codes.

SQL code used for analysis:

select 
b.name, 
c.category,
h.hours,
b.stars,
b.review_count,
b.postal_code
from 
  (business b inner join category c on b.id=c.business_id)
inner join hours h
on h.business_id=c.business_id
where b.city='Toronto'
group by b.stars;


2. Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. 
What differences can you find between the ones that are still open and the ones that are closed? 
List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your answer.
		
+---------+---------------+---------------------------+
| is_open | average stars | average number of reviews |
+---------+---------------+---------------------------+
|       0 | 3.52039473684 |             23.1980263158 |
|       1 | 3.67900943396 |             31.7570754717 |
+---------+---------------+---------------------------+

i. Difference 1:

The businesses that are open have higher star ratings.   
         
ii. Difference 2:

The businesses that are open have on average 8 more reviews.
         
SQL code used for analysis:

select 
is_open, 
avg(stars) as [average stars], 
avg(review_count) as [average number of reviews] 
from business 
group by is_open;

3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct on the Yelp 
dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.

Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment analysis, clustering businesses 
to find commonalities or anomalies between them, predicting the overall star rating for a business, predicting the number 
of fans a user will have, and so on. These are just a few examples to get you started, so feel free to be creative and come 
up with your own problem you want to solve. Provide answers, in-line, to all of the following:
	
i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do:

I would want to model my data to perform a sentment analysis of the users based on the words they used in their reviews to group the user
in two categories satisfied and unsatisfied.

ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:
                           
The type of data required for the sentiment analysis includes the text of the reviews written by users, 
the userid of the user,the tip given by the user, whether the reactions given were cool funny or useful.

I'm choosing this data because NLP will help me figure out the sentiments from the text of the review,
the tip given can help me indicate whether the user was satisfied with the services or not, and the other user 
reactions will help me figure out how the other users perceived the review.

iii. Output of your finished dataset:

Pricing was rather high...  high enough that if the service and sangria weren't so good, I'd skip the next visit without issue. |        |      |       |                                                                             |
| PZNMPWCViVX8JLsn10MSnQ |     3 | Friend and I started with red sangria.  It was pretty awesome.  Merlot + spiced rum and seasonal fruit.  I love a good sangria!                                   |      0 |    0 |     0 | In the time it takes to walk through, pay and check in, my car is spotless. |
